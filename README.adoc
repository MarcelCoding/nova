Nova Framework is a framework on top of spring boot.
It aims to provide nice additions to the spring ecosystem.

== Getting Started

To add it to your project just add this repository and thees dependencies.
To keep your bundle size small it is recommended to only add the modules witch you are need.
Dependencies between modules are resolved automatically.
Keep in mind that you still need a stand-alone spring boot application to start.
You can use the https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializer].
Nova aims to provide out of the box compatibility for https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/[spring native].

Currently, the latest version is:
